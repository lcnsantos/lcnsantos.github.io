I am a physicist specializing in General Relativity and Modified Gravity, with a focus on the classical and quantum dynamics of particles in curved spacetime. My research explores fundamental aspects of gravitational theories and their implications for astrophysical and cosmological phenomena.
In addition to my work in theoretical physics, I am also interested in recent developments in Artificial Intelligence, particularly its applications in scientific research and data analysis.
Feel free to explore my work and reach out for discussions or collaborations.

Here, I'll share some of my favorite equations that capture the elegance and power of theoretical physics.

## Maxwell's Equations: The Harmony of Electromagnetism

Maxwell's equations represent one of the most elegant unifications in physics - the marriage of electricity and magnetism into a single coherent theory. These four equations completely describe classical electromagnetism:

∇ · E = ρ/ε₀

∇ · B = 0

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t

The first pair describes how electric charges create electric fields and how magnetic fields form closed loops without magnetic monopoles. The second pair elegantly demonstrates how changing magnetic fields create electric fields and how electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields.

Maxwell's work essentially proved that light itself is an electromagnetic wave, unifying optics with electromagnetism in one brilliant stroke.
