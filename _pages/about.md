I am a physicist specializing in General Relativity and Modified Gravity, with a focus on the classical and quantum dynamics of particles in curved spacetime. My research explores fundamental aspects of gravitational theories and their implications for astrophysical and cosmological phenomena.
In addition to my work in theoretical physics, I am also interested in recent developments in Artificial Intelligence, particularly its applications in scientific research and data analysis.
Feel free to explore my work and reach out for discussions or collaborations.
